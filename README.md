A finite state machine implemented in Java and JavaScript.

Once wiring together any FSM, printing it to a stream (ie STDOUT) will generate its documentation visually in the form of a directed graph such as a [Melior Graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram) in [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) markup.
